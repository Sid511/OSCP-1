My methodology/process during the OSCP:

25 (BoF) (Root) --> 10 (Stuck) --> 20 (Root) --> 20 (Root) --> 10 (Root) --> 25 (User)
Time remaining: 16 hours. Total score: 4.5/5
Breaks taken: 5-10 minute breaks whenever I got user on a machine.
15-20 minute break every time I completed a box.
Didnâ€™t take any notes at all, screen recorded everything instead for reporting.
